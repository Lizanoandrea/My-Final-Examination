Git is a distributed version control system,
As a contrast to for example subversion that is centralized.
What this means is that with subversion,the code 
Repository (repo) lives on a server and people need
Special permission to be able to add code to the repo.

GitHub facilitates social coding by providing a web
Interface to the Got Code Repository and management tools for
Collaboration.Github can be thought of as a serious networking
Site for software developers.
